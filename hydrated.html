  <h1>Hydrated</h1>
  
  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p><strong>Hydrated</strong> (adjective/verb): Having absorbed or chemically combined with water molecules.</p>
  
  <h2>Etymology</h2>
  <p>From Greek <em>hydro-</em>, meaning "water," with the suffix <em>-ated</em>, indicating a state or condition.</p>

    <h2>Common Uses</h2>
    <ul class="expandable-list">
      <li class="dropdown">
        <div class="dropdown-trigger"><strong>Chemistry:</strong> Hydrated salts contain water molecules in their crystal structure</div>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
          <p><strong>Crystal Structure:</strong> Water molecules occupy specific positions within the crystal lattice.</p>
          <p><strong>Color Changes:</strong> Hydration often causes dramatic color changes (e.g., white to blue copper sulfate).</p>
          <p><strong>Reversibility:</strong> Many hydrated salts can be dehydrated by heating and rehydrated by adding water.</p>

        <div class="dropdown-trigger"><strong>Medicine:</strong> Proper hydration is essential for bodily functions</div>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
          <p><strong>Cellular Function:</strong> Water enables enzymatic reactions, nutrient transport, and waste removal.</p>
          <p><strong>Temperature Regulation:</strong> Sweating and respiration depend on adequate hydration for cooling.</p>
          <p><strong>Clinical Treatment:</strong> IV fluids restore hydration in patients unable to drink adequate amounts.</p>

        <div class="dropdown-trigger"><strong>Materials:</strong> Hydrated cement gains strength through water absorption</div>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
          <p><strong>Hydration Process:</strong> Chemical reaction between cement and water forms calcium silicate hydrate gel.</p>
          <p><strong>Strength Development:</strong> Continues for months as more cement particles react with available water.</p>
          <p><strong>Quality Control:</strong> Proper water-to-cement ratio crucial for achieving desired strength and durability.</p>

        <div class="dropdown-trigger"><strong>Biology:</strong> Hydrated proteins maintain their structure and function</div>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
          <p><strong>Protein Folding:</strong> Water molecules help stabilize secondary and tertiary protein structures.</p>
          <p><strong>Enzyme Activity:</strong> Active sites require specific hydration for substrate binding and catalysis.</p>
          <p><strong>Preservation:</strong> Dehydration can denature proteins, while proper hydration maintains biological activity.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ul class="expandable-list">
      <li class="dropdown">
        <div class="dropdown-trigger">Hydrated copper sulfate (CuSO₄·5H₂O) appears blue due to water molecules</div>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
          <p><strong>Color Mechanism:</strong> Water molecules coordinate with copper ions, creating the characteristic blue color.</p>
          <p><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Heating removes water, turning the compound white and demonstrating reversible hydration.</p>
          <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Used as fungicide, algaecide, and in electroplating processes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dropdown-trigger">Athletes must stay hydrated during exercise</div>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
          <p><strong>Performance Impact:</strong> Even 2% dehydration can significantly reduce athletic performance and endurance.</p>
          <p><strong>Electrolyte Balance:</strong> Sports drinks replace both water and essential minerals lost through sweating.</p>
          <p><strong>Recovery:</strong> Proper rehydration after exercise is crucial for muscle recovery and glycogen replenishment.</p>
