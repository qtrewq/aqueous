  <h1>Hydrous</h1>
  
  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p><strong>Hydrous</strong> (adjective): Containing water molecules as an integral part of its structure or composition.</p>
  
  <h2>Etymology</h2>
  <p>From Greek <em>hydro-</em>, meaning "water," combined with the suffix <em>-ous</em>, meaning "having the quality of."</p>
